## Bitcoin Core performance monitor ðŸ“ˆ

[bitcoinperf.com](https://bitcoinperf.com)

This repository consists of a few components

- a [codespeed](https://github.com/chaincodelabs/codespeed) installation which
  collects and presents benchmarking results in a web interface, and
- a haphazard Python script for running high-level Bitcoin Core benchmarks which
  POSTs results to codespeed, and
- a Grafana interface for presenting the benchmark results.

The benchmarks which are monitored are

- Build time (make)
- Unittest duration (make check)
- Functional test framework duration (test/functional/test_runner.py)
- Microbenchmarks (bench-bitcoin)
- IBD up to some height from a local peer or from the P2P network
- Reindex up to some height

The Python script (`bitcoinperf`) may be used as a standalone script
(in conjunction with the Docker configuration) to benchmark and compare
different Bitcoin commits locally - without necessarily writing to a remote
codespeed instance.


### Example local usage

First, you may have to modify the `synced` mountpoint in `docker-compose.yml`
from `/data/bitcoin_bench` to a path on your machine that corresponds to a
Bitcoin datadir which is synced up to your desired stopatheight.

Install docker & docker-compose, then run

#
```sh
# Bring up codespeed server and a synced bitcoind instance

$ ./bin/dev up codespeed

# Modify docker-compose.yml to reference a synced datadir on your host machine.

$ sed -ie 's#/data/bitcoin_bench#/path/to/your/datadir#g' docker-compose.dev.yml

# Compare v0.17.0 to the current tip

$ ./bin/dev runbench \
    bitcoinperf \
    --commits "v0.16.0,master" \
    --run-counts ibd:3 --benches-to-run gitclone,build,ibd --bitcoind-stopatheight 200000

```

### Running unittests

```sh
$ ./bin/dev up codespeed
$ ./bin/dev test
```

### Configuring Grafana

Grafana dashboards can be recreated locally by importing the JSON files
stored in `grafana_management/backups/`.

When dashboards are edited on the live environment, they should be backed up
using `grafana_management/backup_dashboard_json.sh`.

In order for the saved Grafana dashboard configurations to work, you'll need
to make sure you've installed the Postgres views contained in
`codespeed/migrations/001-result-views.sql`.
